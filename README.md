# Router1x3
The router accepts data packets on a single 8-bit port and routes them to one of the three output channels, channel0, channel1 and channel2. These routers are commonly used in audio and video applications, such as distributing a single signal to multiple speakers or displays. The resulting router provides a simple and cost-effective solution for distributing signals to multiple destinations.
