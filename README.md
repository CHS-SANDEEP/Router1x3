# Router1x3
->Router 1x3 design projects involve the creation of a router that can take one input signal and split it into three output signals.
->These routers are commonly used in audio and video applications, such as distributing a single signal to multiple speakers or displays.
->The resulting router provides a simple and cost-effective solution for distributing signals to multiple destinations.
